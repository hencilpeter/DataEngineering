Hencil : 20 - 27
20 Json
   - prepare json from dictionary ( 3 student records ), list, tuple and normal variables  
   - create a common function that receive the json object and print the same on the command prompt (use indent 4).
   - implement function to change json data separator and print the same on the prompt. 
   - Implement a function to read a json file from the disk and print the result. 
   - Implement a function to write a json data to a file. 
21 RegEx (regular expression)
   Use regular expression library and do the following:
   -  print if the given string pattern in the given string or not. 
      i.e. pattern start/end with specific string, contains some character in the middle.    
   -  find all the patterns in the given string. 
   -  split the given string using the delimiter "space"
   -  replace the specific string pattern with another string pattern. 
   -  print the match object. i.e return object of search function.    
22 Try…Except 
   Write a program to use try/except (NameError, etc) /finally/else with proper example.
    -Additionally, use raise keyword to raise own exception. 
	              use raise keyword to raise Typeerror.
	- open a file/print content/close the file and ensure block of code is protected by try/except/finally.
   
23 User Input and String formatting 
   - use input function to read the customer’s name, age, salary and percentage of tax from the terminal.
   - print the result in the below format:
     ******************************************************
	 Name       : <cus name>                      Age : <age>
     Salary     : <2 decimal formatted value>  
     Tax      % : <Tax>
     Income Tax :
     *******************************************************	 
24 File Handling 
     - Implement a python function to read a file  using read function with mode "rt" mode.
	 -  print the first 25 characters of a file. 
	 -  print the first 5 lines of a file. 
	 -  Read the file content, change each words' first character to capital letter and write back the contend to a file. 
	 -  Write few lines of string content using append mode. 
	 -  write function to remove a file and directory. 
	 /readfiles
25. using yield, zip, broadcast to
    - implement a function to return all the even numbers and generate the results using yield function. 
	- merge two list (name and age ) and print each customer name and age individually
	- create a numpy array and apply broadcast features 
26. numpy 
	Create a 4X2 integer array and Prints its attributes
	Create a 5X2 integer array from a range between 100 to 200 such that the difference between each element is 10
	Create a result array by adding the following two NumPy arrays. Next, modify the result array by calculating the square of each element
	Return array of odd rows and even columns from below numpy array
	Split the array into four equal-sized sub-arrays
	Sort following NumPy array
	Print max from axis 0 and min from axis 1 from the following 2-D
	Delete the second column from a given array and insert the following new column in its place.

27. pandas
	 - construct a dataframe with five rows and do the below tasks stated:
	   name, nric, age,  account balance, country 
	(i)  print the first, middle and last 2 records 
    (ii) find the youngest customer and print his/her nric/name, balance
    (iii) print everyone from USA
	(iv) find the average balance of customers from USA 

28. String formatting 
    - use string format() function and print customer name and salary using 2 decimal formatting. 
	- use string format() using index numbers 
    - use string format() using named index
