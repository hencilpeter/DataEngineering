What, as a team, we do
--------------------

In Citibank, we as a team work on the TradeCapture and LifeCycle of the derivative products.

As part of the TradeCapture, we support the booking of positions on derivative products. So we provide UI screens to book positions/trades on major derivative products like Options, Exotic Options and different types of Swaps (Equity Swaps, Interest Rate Swaps, etc.).

As part of LifeCycle, we support fixing (capturing the market value of the product based on its schedule). We do EQUITY, FLOATING and DIVIDEND fixings. We also do payment generation.

1. Financial Instrument
Financial instruments are assets (or packages of capital) that can be traded.  
These assets can be cash, a contractual right to deliver or receive cash or evidence of one's ownership of an entity.

Takeaways:
(i) A financial instrument is a real or virtual document representing a legal agreement involving any kind of monetary value. 
(ii) Financial instruments may be divided into two types: cash instruments and derivative instruments.
(ii) Financial instruments may also be divided according to an asset class, which depends on whether they are debt-based or equity-based.
(iv) Foreign exchange instruments comprise a third, unique type of financial instrument.

Types of Financial Instruments:

(i) Cash Instruments
- Cash instruments may also be deposits and loans agreed upon by borrowers and lenders.
- These can be securities that are easily transferable.

(ii) Derivative Instruments
The value and characteristics of derivative instruments are based on the vehicle’s underlying components, such as assets, interest rates, or indices.
For example, An equity options contract, is a derivative because it derives its value from the underlying stock. The option gives the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the stock at a specified price and by a certain date. There can be over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives or exchange-traded derivatives. OTC is a market or process whereby securities–that are not listed on formal exchanges–are priced and traded.

Types of Asset Classes of Financial Instruments

(i) Debt-Based Financial Instruments
	Short-term debt-based financial instruments last for one year or less.
		Exchange-traded derivatives under short-term, debt-based financial instruments can be short-term interest rate futures. 
		OTC derivatives are forward rate agreements.

Long-term debt-based financial instruments last for more than a year. Under securities, these are bonds. Cash equivalents are loans. Exchange-traded derivatives are bond futures and options on bond futures. OTC derivatives are interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, interest rate options, and exotic derivatives.

(ii) Equity-Based Financial Instruments
Securities under equity-based financial instruments are stocks. Exchange-traded derivatives in this category include stock options and equity futures. The OTC derivatives are stock options and exotic derivatives.

Special Considerations
There are no securities under foreign exchange. Cash equivalents come in spot foreign exchange, which is the current prevailing rate. Exchange-traded derivatives under foreign exchange are currency futures. OTC derivatives come in foreign exchange options, outright forwards, and foreign exchange swaps.
