What, as a team, we do
--------------------

In Citibank, we as a team work on the TradeCapture and LifeCycle of the derivative products.

As part of the TradeCapture, we support the booking of positions on derivative products. So we provide UI screens to book positions/trades on major derivative products like Options, Exotic Options and different types of Swaps (Equity Swaps, Interest Rate Swaps, etc.).

As part of LifeCycle, we support fixing (capturing the market value of the product based on its schedule). We do EQUITY, FLOATING and DIVIDEND fixings. We also do payment generation.
